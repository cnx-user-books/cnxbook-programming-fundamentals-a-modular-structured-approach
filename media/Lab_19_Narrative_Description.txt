You are to write a program named Lab_19.cpp that does the following:

1. You will want to use the Demo_Sum_Array_Function.cpp as 
   a starting point.  Make sure that you change the comments
   to a correct filename, purpose, author and date, etc.

2. You will use the Demo_Farm_Acres_Input.txt data file.

3. Leave all of the existing code in place. You will be adding a 
   function that returns an integer value after being passed an 
   array and the number of array elements.  The value it should 
   return is the average of the values that are within the array.
   Since we are dealing with integer values within this lab, we 
   will use integer division.  The average would be the total 
   divided by the number of elements in the array and it will 
   truncate to a whole number and that is OK!  The name of the
   function should be: average_array  

4. Display the average within the function main following the 
   display of the sum.
