You are to write a program named Lab_24.cpp that does the following:

1. Includes variable definitions in C++ (not human definitions) that
   use all of the following data types:

   a. Boolean
   b. character
   c. integer
   d. floating-point (you may use either float or double)
   e. string
   f. array (single dimension)
   g. pointer

2. Defines at least one constant with an identifier name.

3. Includes all of the following types of functions:

   a. At least one program control function 
      HINT: You can use more than one.
   b. A header file that includes the: monitor.h
        and
      a call to at least the: clear_m 
      which is a user defined specific task function
   c. A call to at least one Standard Library function
      HINT: You might need to include a header file.

4. Includes all of the following control structures:

   a. if then else
   b. case - Remember you must use switch with break
   c. do while
   d. while
   e. for 


5. Of necessity you will use a variety of operators, however you
   must use/demonstrate all of the following:

   a. integer division
   b. modulus
   c. array index
   d. indirection

Here are some hints for success:

A. You may want to at least sketch out a plan before you start coding.
   Not necessarily a complete pseudocode but a little thought as to 
   what you are going to do and check off the above items to make
   sure that they are planned for.  Some students use the menu structure
   learned in Chapter 16 as a starting point. 

B. To make it easy to grade, place the definitions for variables and constants
   (as described in items 1 and 2 above) before the function main.

C. Build and test your program in steps. Otherwise, you may encounter 
   impossible to solve compiler errors. 

D. Don't give up before you start. This lab should be done as you 
   prepare for your final exam. It is designed to have you cover
   major items and concepts that are within the first 22 chapters.

E. There are 20 individual items listed between the 5 items above.
   Each will be worth 0.5 points and this assignment will be graded by 
   simply telling you which ones you missed and did not do.
