*************************************************************

You are to write a program named Lab_18.cpp that does the following:

1. Create two (2) single dimension arrays (lists) as follows:

   a. The first array will have between 4 to 8 members of integer 
      data type and will be the IQs (Intelligent Quotient - usually
      values between 80 and 150) for those people.

   b. The second array will have 6 members of floating point data
      type (either float or double) and will be the amount of cash
      (paper and coin) money that each of 6 people have in their 
      pockets (or wallet or purse).  Example: I have $5.32 in my pocket. 
 
2. Allow the person running the program to change the IQ of 
   the 2nd member of the array.

3. Display the values for each array with a for loop using 
   the sizeof operator to determine the number of members in
   the array for the test expression.

4. You may want to use the Demo_Arrays.cpp as 
   a starting point.  If you do, make sure that you get rid 
   of any lines of code not needed and make sure you change the
   comments to a correct filename, purpose, author and date, etc.
