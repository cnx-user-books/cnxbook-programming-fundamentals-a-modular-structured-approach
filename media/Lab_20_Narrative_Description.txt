*************************************************************

You are to write a program named Lab_20.cpp that does the following:

1. You will want to use the Demo_Finding_Array_Member.cpp as 
   a starting point.  Make sure that you change the comments
   to a correct filename, purpose, author and date, etc.

2. You will use the Demo_Farm_Acres_Input.txt data file.

3. Leave all of the existing code in place. You will be adding a 
   function that returns an integer value after being passed an 
   array and the number of array elements.  The value it should 
   return is the minimum (smallest) value that is within the array.
   The name of the function should be: min_array

4. Display the minimum value within the function main following the 
   display of the maximum value.
