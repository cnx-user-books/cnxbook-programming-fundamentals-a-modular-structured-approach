Programming Hints

1. Don't try writing the program all at once.  You can
   eat an elephant but only one bite at a time. Suggestion:

   a. Complete the do while loop but dont' do the case (switch).
      Compile and test it.
   b. Add the case with only one item (item A) and build the 
      function for item A.  
      compile and test it. 
   c. Build each additional menu item one at a time. 
      Compile and test it before doing the next menu item.

2. Review as needed:

   a. Chapter 6 on Program Control functions
   b. Chapter 7 on User Defined Specific Task functions
   c. The chapters within the Structrued Progrramming Group,
      chapters 11 to 15, as needed for each control structure
      that you are using.

3. Pay attention to braces. They are always in pairs. One  
   starting and one stoping. Review the module:
   "Documentation and Making Source Code Readable" that is
   in Chapter 6.
