input
   display a message asking user for the length of the house
   get the length of the house from the keyboard
   display a message asking user for the width of the house
   get the width of the house from the keyboard
   display a message asking user for the height of the house
   get the height of the house from the keyboard
   display a message asking user for the price of a gallon of paint
   get the price of a gallon of paint from the keyboard
   display a message asking user for the sq ft coverage of a gallon of paint
   get the sq ft coverate of a gallon of paint from the keyboard
 
processing
   calculate the total area of the building by:
      1) multiplying the length by height by 2;
      2) then multiply the width by height by 2;
      3) then add the two results together
   calculate the number of gallons of paint needed by:
      1) dividing the total area by the coverage per gallon;
      2) and then round up to the next whole gallon
   calculate the total cost of the paint by:
      1) multiplying the total gallons needed by the price of one gallon of paint
                                
output
   display the total gallon of paint needed with an appropriate message
   display the total cost with an appropriate message
   pause so the user can see the answer
