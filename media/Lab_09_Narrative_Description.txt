*************************************************************
In the mid-west many farmers irrigate from a well near
the center of a piece of land using a circular
irrigation system. The farmer plans on farming an 
almost square (but it is a rectangle) piece of 
property and needs to know some answers for planning.

This program is to get two measurements for a rectangular
piece of property.  The measurements will be in feet,
and should be identified with variables named length 
width. The program is to calculate the area in square
feet of the rectangle and the largest circle that could
fit into the rectangle.

The farmer wants to know the acreage of:

1. the property
2. the farmable area
3. the non-farmable area

You are to Google Internet to determine how many
square feet are in a acre.

A graphic of farms using this type of irrigation is
provided.

A hierarchy chart is provided and you are to name
your program control functions (middle level) as shown.
You are to use specific task functions (lowest level)
from the user libraries as appropriate.

*************************************************************
NOTE: The farmer is smart enough to enter the longer side of 
the property as the length and the shorter side of the 
property as the width. You should not include any code for 
checking to see if he did it right or wrong or fixing it if
he did it wrong.
