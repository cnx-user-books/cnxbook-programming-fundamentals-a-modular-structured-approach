      <para id="id7982241">A <emphasis>pointer</emphasis> variable is a variable that holds the address of a memory location. "Every variable is assigned a memory location whose address can be retrieved using the address operator &amp;. The address of a memory location is called a pointer."<footnote id="id7186356">Tony Gaddis, Judy Walters and Godfrey Muganda, <emphasis effect="underline">Starting Out with C++ Early Objects Sixth Edition</emphasis> (United States of America: Pearson â€“ Addison Wesley, 2008) 597.</footnote> The <emphasis>pointer data type</emphasis> allows us to designate a variable to hold an address or a pointer. The concept of an address and a pointer are one in the same. A pointer points to the location in memory because the value of a pointer is the address were the data item resides in the memory. Given an integer variable named age: </para>
